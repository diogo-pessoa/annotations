The U.S. Commerce Department, through its Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), regulates the
export of certain technologies, software, and goods that have implications for national security,
foreign policy, and economic interests. The primary mechanism for these controls is the Export
Administration Regulations (EAR), which govern the export, re-export, and transfer (in-country) of
commercial and dual-use items. Dual-use items are those that have both commercial and military or
proliferation applications.

* **Virtual sprawl** - refers to the uncontrolled expansion of digital infrastructure, resources,
  and platforms within an organization, often resulting in inefficiencies, management challenges,
  and increased cybersecurity risks. This concept is analogous to urban sprawl, where unchecked
  growth leads to disorganized development, resource depletion, and difficulty in management.

* **COBIT** (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies) is a framework for governing and managing enterprise IT. It was developed by ISACA (Information Systems Audit and Control Association) to help organizations achieve their goals for information technology governance and management, ensuring that IT investments align with business objectives and deliver value while managing risks and resources effectively.

* NIST - **NIST 800-53** is a comprehensive framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to provide guidelines for selecting and implementing security and privacy controls in federal information systems and organizations. Part of the NIST Special Publication 800 series, it supports compliance with the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) and aims to protect government data and infrastructure by detailing a set of security controls to manage risk effectively.

The framework categorizes controls into families such as Access Control, Incident Response, and Risk Assessment, and includes mechanisms like baselines, assessment procedures, and control enhancements. NIST 800-53 emphasizes key principles such as least privilege, audit and accountability, and contingency planning to ensure robust security postures. The controls are designed to be scalable and adaptable, applicable not only to federal systems but also to private sector organizations seeking to align with best practices for information security and privacy.


The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is a multinational entity that creates nonbinding policy suggestions for its member countries. The OECD has published recommendations for privacy laws
