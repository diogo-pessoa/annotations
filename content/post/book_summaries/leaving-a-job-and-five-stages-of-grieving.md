## Introduction

Recently, I left my full-time job after six years. Even though it was my decision to move
on. I still experienced moments of sadness, anger, and doubt during my last days. When I came across
_Kübler-Ross and Kessler's (2005)_[1](#references) concept of the five stages of grief, it helped me
understand my
loss. I contextualized my experience through the descriptions of these five stages of grieving.

## The "loss" of a job

Much like losing a loved one, leaving a job causes a massive change in routine and relationships.

To avoid being too nostalgic, here are a few things nobody ever misses in any job, old or new:

The endless meetings where the people talking the most are the ones with the least to say.

The "know-it-alls" with a one-stop solution to every problem. Often, implausible, sometimes absurd.

The authoritarian bosses (who refer to themselves as leaders). They'll ask you to work harder during
the holiday season. It's the "mission", the company needs you. Meanwhile they enjoy time-off with
their families. When they return from their holiday, they expect results (your results). Which,
they'll happily take credit for.

It might sound like I'm describing a single company. But am I? When we look around, these
stereotypes are present in most companies.

With that out of the way, let's move on.

Even when it's the worker's choice to leave, there are many things left behind:

* The familiarity with the working environment.
* The pet projects you helped from the start.
* The familiar faces by the water cooler.
* The casual fun interactions with teammates. (Yes, video calls are just as good as face-to-face;
  it's 2024, get over it).

There was a feeling of emptiness when thinking of the list above. I came to realize that's **grief
**.

## The five stages of grieving

A worthwhile quote regarding the stages: "They are responses to loss that many people have, but
there is not a typical response to loss, as there is no typical loss. Our grief is as individual as
our lives." – Kübler-Ross and Kessler (2005, p. 25)[1](#references)

### Denial

When you have a notice period, you're still in the company, still working. It's easy to forget that
you're leaving. You're still in the same place, doing the same things.

Whereas when it's a sudden change, where you leave the same day, the sudden change can take time to
sink in. It almost feels like a long holiday. It takes time to realize you're not going back to the
office.

### Anger

This is a strange one for me. Anger is a familiar to me, a struggle to keep in check. In the context
of leaving by choice. It reminds me to that sense of frustration. When your expectations aren't met.
I'm not a fan of the blame game. Yet, it's easy to play stories in your head, creating the
us-vs-them narratives.

When you're laid off, it's easier to direct that anger at the company. To blame the old boss, the
unreasonable expectations. It's a natural response to the loss of a job.

### Bargaining

This is the stage where I started to think about the "what-ifs". In my case, I considered internal
moves, only delaying the inevitable. But, I needed to justify, and the delay was a false hope of
things getting better.
The truth was, I was done; I had already moved on. But you linger, you let yourself work on
autopilot for a few more weeks.

When being laid off, I can only think of this stage as more intense. You might try to negotiate or
believe you can revert it somehow. It's a mind trap; letting this go on can cause a loop,
fluctuating with anger and bargaining.

### Depression

“Depression is not a sign of mental illness. It is the appropriate response to a great loss” —
Kübler-Ross and Kessler (2005 p. 50) [1](#references)

I confess when you decide to leave, you're already looking forward to the next chapter. There's a
sense of anticipation that reduces the sadness. Regardless, the last days are tough. You're leaving
a lot behind, the familiar faces, the routine. It's a loss, and it's okay to feel sad about it.

If you were laid off, the depression can be more intense. The sense of loss, mixed with the sense of
powerlessness is overwhelming. It's easy to cycle back through anger and hope at this point.

### Acceptance

In accepting the change, you're acknowledging the loss and getting ready for the next move. It
doesn't mean you're happy about it. It means you're acknowledging the facts as they are and acting
within your control.

## The Story we tell ourselves

Storytelling is powerful. How we frame it influences how we navigate grieving.

When moving on, the story is vivid, sometimes painful, and often it captures all your attention. We
can get caught up in the story.

The term "ruminating" comes to mind. Jessica McCabe in her channel "How to ADHD" talks
about [thoughts-spiral](https://youtu.be/_x9Y77Ta83I?si=-vqQXjFcRaRaeBlZ). It's important to get
yourself out of the thought spiral to heal.

We need to reframe the story. To address the thought spiral, what worked for me was writing it down.
Dale Carnegie in his book "How to Stop Worrying and Start Living"[2](#references) has a chapter on "
How to Face
Trouble."

He suggests writing down the problem, the worst that can happen, and the solution. It's a simple
exercise, but it helped me put things in perspective and think in larger time scales.

Here are the steps in more detail:

1. **Get the Facts**

* When getting facts, pretend you're collecting them for someone else.
* Prepare to argue the other side (devil's advocate).
* Write down both sides (write the facts). A problem well stated is a problem half solved.

2. **Ask yourself, and write down the answer**

* What am I worrying about?
* What can I do about it?
* Here's what I'm going to do about it.
* When will I start? (This is the most important step. Having a deadline makes it concrete.)

## Getting Closure

Common definition: **_"act of closing or the state of being closed; a bringing to an end, a
conclusion."_**

**_"Closure has taken on the clichéd meaning of 'wrapping up a situation.' We are pressured to find
closure on the work situation, the romantic relationship, and even on a death."_** – Kübler-Ross and
Kessler (2005, p. 244)[1](#references)

**_"In the loss of a young loved one such as Johnny, people may oversimplify the stages. We expect
six
months of denial, then a few months of anger and depression, followed by some bargaining. Finally,
we expect to find acceptance, which we imagine will lead to some type of 'closure.' It's never as
easy as items on a checklist."_** – Kübler-Ross and Kessler (2005, p. 246)[1](#references)

When you spend a long time in a place, you collect stories. Building memories in learning from
people. Sharing and teaching the younger generation. That space and time are also a part of your
story. Trying to "get over it" is not the point. Trying to suppress is another form of **denial**.
When
you look back on those moments with nostalgia, when the anger and resentment give way to a smile.
Only then, you've found closure.

## Final Thoughts

"Grief is the intense emotional response to the pain of a loss. It is the reflection of a connection
that has been broken. Most important, grief is an emotional, spiritual, and psychological journey to
healing." – Kübler-Ross and Kessler (2005, p. 346)[1](#references)

When you're closing a chapter, grieve, feel whatever you need to feel. But do it deliberately,
acknowledge, reflect on the moments, and draw the story to an end. Not the end, an end. That last
job was a chapter. There's a whole new world of experiences. Indeed, fear is a constant companion.
But, that means you're living a whole set of first times. Fear is a healthy response and will make
you alert. Use it and get moving again.

If you're one of those who believes our story is already written, fine, But, here's an analogy to
reconcile. You're making unplanned additions to your story. If anything, you're making that book
more interesting.

I choose to accept and embrace randomness. We're lucky to be here, lucky to have worked there and
collected some stories. Whatever happens next, it's a bunch of random events that can go either way.
So if you left a bad job, there's a good chance it will get better. Lucky you!

If it gets worse, sorry to hear. Don't lose heart. Probability helps here too; in flipping coins,
the chances of a streak are low. So, keep flipping that coin. It's bound to turn around,
eventually you'll be saved by
the [regression toward the mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean).
