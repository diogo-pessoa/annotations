My take Reflection from the content below is how little I found from the author in such a critical topic. It feels
almost as we're so uncomfortable with talking about risk that we avoid it. It's like the tool for click bait
avoidance.
 
My interpretations from topics throughout book, which I relate to Nassim N. Taleb, book: "Skin in the Game".

## Highlights from the book

### Introduction

Many of the worst disasters in history started quite modestly. (p. 6) [1](#references)

Why did parents fail to recognize their own children at the hospital—and, especially, at the morgue? Small details nagged at Prince. On the morning of the explosion, why was the very first relief station set up by a troupe of actors, of all people? (p. 7)

“Catastrophe and Social Change,” published in 1920, was the first systematic analysis of human behavior in a disaster. “Life becomes like molten metal,” he wrote. “Old customs crumble, and instability rules.”


The horrific explosion had, in the end, “blown Halifax into the 20th century,” forcing many changes that were for the better. His thesis opened with a quote from St. Augustine: “This awful catastrophe is not the end but the beginning. History does not end so. It is the way its chapters open.” (p. 8)

Prince seemed to anticipate the temptation for people to avert their eyes. “This little volume on Halifax is offered as a beginning,” he wrote. Don’t let it be the end, he pleaded. “Knowledge will grow scientific only after the most faithful examination of many catastrophes.”

We worry about horrible things happening to us, but we don’t know much about what it actually feels like. I wondered what they had learned. I started to research the stories of survivors from other disasters. The overlaps were startling. People in shipwrecks, plane crashes, and floodwaters all seemed to undergo a mysterious metamorphosis. They performed better than they ever would have expected in some ways and much worse in others.

In New Orleans, after Hurricane Katrina, I learned more from regular people on street corners than I learned covering any homeland security conference.

Ironically, after writing a book about disasters, I feel less anxious overall, not more. I am a much better judge of risk now that I understand my own warped equation for dread. Having studied dozens of plane crashes, I’m more relaxed when I’m flying. And no matter how many Code-Orange-be-afraid-be-very-afraid alerts I see on the evening news, I feel some amount of peace having already glimpsed the worst-case scenario. The truth, it turns out, is usually better than the nightmare.

Narrative is the beginning of recovery. But narrative can miss important subplots.

Rescuers from California raced to help. Search-and-rescue dogs were ordered up. But first, before anyone else, regular people were on the scene saving one another. They did incredible things, these regular people. They lifted rubble off survivors with car jacks. They used garden hoses to force air into voids where people were trapped. In fact, as in most disasters, the vast majority of rescues were done by ordinary folks. After the first two hours, very few people came out of the debris alive. The search-and-rescue dogs did not arrive until twenty-six hours after the explosion.

survival often depends on the behavior of the passenger. These facts have been well known in the aviation industry for a long time. But unless people have been in a plane crash, most individuals have no idea.

willful brand of denial. This denial can take the form of delay, which can be fatal,

At the moment of impact, Zedeño had entered a rarefied zone. The rules of normal life were suspended.

Talking about it now, in a deli across from the void where the towers once stood, Zedeño wonders why she didn’t immediately run for the stairs. She’d been through this before, after
 
series of phases along the survival arc. First would be a thicket of disbelief, followed by frantic deliberation, and, finally, action.

After the plane hit the building, Zedeño told me, she wanted nothing so much as to stay. Like her, I was perplexed by this reaction. Shouldn’t a primal, survival instinct have kicked in, propelling her to the door? I wondered if Zedeño was unusual.

met Jack Rowley, who spent thirty-three years as a firefighter...  he told me that he saw this kind of curious indifference all the time.

His station house would get dispatched to a bar; he would walk into the establishment and see smoke. But he would also see customers sitting at the bar nursing their beers. “We would say, ‘Looks like there’s a fire here,’” he says. He’d ask the customers if they felt like evacuating. “They would say, ‘No, we’ll be just fine.’”

“Actual human behavior in fires is somewhat different from the ‘panic’ scenario. What is regularly observed is a lethargic response,”

about half the passengers do in this moment of exquisite tension? Did they panic or weep or pray to God? No. They laughed. The plane, as it turned out, landed safely. And Kaminski was left to marvel at his fellow passengers’ well-developed sense of irony.

The human brain works by identifying patterns.

Amanda Ripley. Unthinkable, The - Amanda Ripley (p. 33). Kindle Edition. 

This strategy works elegantly in most situations. But we inevitably see patterns where they don’t exist. In other words, we are slow to recognize exceptions. There is also the peer-pressure factor. All of us have been in situations that looked ominous, and they almost always turn out to be innocuous. If we behave otherwise, we risk social embarrassment by overreacting. So we err on the side of underreacting.
