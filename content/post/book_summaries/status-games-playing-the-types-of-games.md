In *The Status Game* by Will Storr, he explores how human beings are deeply driven by the need for status, which is reflected in our behavior, psychology, and social interactions. Storr outlines three main types of status games that people play:

1. **Dominance**: This type of status game is based on power and control. People playing dominance games assert their status by force, intimidation, or displays of superiority over others. Historically, this is seen in tribal leaders, dictators, or anyone using coercion to gain respect.

2. **Virtue**: Virtue status games are centered on moral superiority. Individuals gain status by showing themselves as virtuous, ethical, or adhering to moral standards. Today, this can often be seen in social movements, religious communities, or even social media, where people demonstrate their "goodness" or alignment with particular causes.

3. **Success**: Success status games are about achievement, competence, and measurable success in various domains—whether it's wealth, career, talent, or intellectual accomplishment. Status is gained through expertise, accolades, and recognition for accomplishments.

These games often overlap, and individuals or groups may play multiple games simultaneously to achieve status in different spheres of life.

...

Virtue games, as described in *The Status Game* by Will Storr, revolve around moral superiority and demonstrating adherence to certain ethical or moral standards. The characteristics of these games often include:

1. **Moral Signaling**: Individuals in virtue games often make public displays of their values or beliefs, signaling their moral alignment with a particular group or cause. This can happen through actions, language, or social behavior that shows how "good" or "righteous" they are. Social media, for example, is a common platform for this kind of signaling.

2. **Ingroup vs. Outgroup Dynamics**: Virtue games often draw clear boundaries between those who are part of a "morally righteous" group (ingroup) and those who are seen as morally inferior or wrong (outgroup). People in virtue games may criticize, shame, or even "cancel" those who don’t align with their values or beliefs.

3. **Social Reinforcement**: Players in virtue games often receive social rewards—praise, recognition, or increased status—by acting in ways that reflect the shared morals or ethics of their community. This reinforcement strengthens their participation in the game and motivates them to continue demonstrating their virtue.

4. **Moral Hierarchies**: Like all status games, virtue games involve a hierarchy, but it’s based on how virtuous or morally aligned someone is perceived to be. The more someone can display adherence to the group’s moral code, the higher they climb in this hierarchy.

5. **Identity and Belonging**: Virtue games are deeply tied to group identity. People playing these games often derive a sense of belonging and purpose from being part of a group that shares their values. This connection reinforces their loyalty to the group and their motivation to play the virtue game.

6. **Punishment and Exclusion**: In virtue games, those who violate the group’s moral code or who are perceived as less virtuous may face punishment, such as social ostracism, public shaming, or being "called out" or "canceled." This mechanism helps enforce the group's moral boundaries and keeps members in line.

Overall, virtue games are often about establishing a moral order within a group, and people gain status by showing that they uphold the group's values better than others. However, these games can also lead to intense competition and conflict when different groups or individuals have competing definitions of what constitutes virtue.

...

When someone playing the success status game is insecure, it can manifest in several ways that reflect their uncertainty about their achievements or standing. Here are some key traits that might emerge:

1. **Constant Need for Validation**: Insecure players often seek external validation to reinforce their sense of worth. They may obsessively pursue accolades, promotions, or recognition and feel anxious or distressed when they don't receive the praise they expect.

2. **Comparisons with Others**: Insecure individuals tend to compare themselves to others constantly. They may feel threatened by others' success or accomplishments and worry that they don't measure up. This comparison often leads to envy or resentment.

3. **Overcompensation**: To mask their insecurity, some players may overcompensate by boasting or exaggerating their achievements. They might display a sense of superiority or arrogance to protect their fragile self-esteem.

4. **Fear of Failure**: Insecure success players often fear failure deeply because their sense of self-worth is tied to their achievements. This fear can lead to risk aversion, perfectionism, or avoidance of challenges where they might not succeed.

5. **Imposter Syndrome**: Some insecure individuals feel like they don't truly deserve their success and worry that they'll be exposed as frauds. This imposter syndrome can make them anxious, despite external signs of success, because they internally doubt their own competence.

6. **Difficulty Handling Criticism**: Insecure success players may struggle to handle criticism, even when it's constructive. Because their self-worth is linked to their success, any critique can feel like a personal attack, leading to defensiveness or even withdrawal.

These behaviors stem from a deep-rooted concern that their success is not enough or that they don’t fully deserve the status they’ve achieved, which can make the game more stressful and less fulfilling.

...

Great connection! In *Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers*, Robert Sapolsky examines stress responses in animals, especially in social hierarchies like those found in chimpanzee tribes and baboon troops. He describes a pattern where stress is passed down through the social ranks—often called "displacement aggression." When a higher-ranking individual, like the leader, asserts dominance by punishing or stressing the second-in-command, that individual will often redirect their stress and aggression onto someone lower in the hierarchy, typically the third-in-command. This creates a chain reaction of stress and aggression throughout the group.

Now, correlating this to the success status game and insecurity:

1. **Displacement of Stress and Insecurity**: Just as in baboon or chimpanzee hierarchies, insecure individuals in a success game might "displace" their stress or feelings of inadequacy onto others. For instance, when faced with criticism or a challenge from a superior, they may vent their frustration on subordinates or those they perceive as less successful, in an attempt to maintain or regain control. It’s similar to the "kick-down" response seen in animal hierarchies.

2. **Hierarchical Behavior**: In both the animal and human social hierarchies, lower-ranking individuals often bear the brunt of the insecurities of those just above them. In a corporate or competitive environment, someone insecure in their success might micromanage, criticize, or blame their team, similar to how the second-in-rank in baboon hierarchies takes out their frustrations on those lower down. This is an attempt to maintain their status by asserting dominance or competence over someone they perceive as less of a threat.

3. **Stress and Status Maintenance**: Sapolsky points out how the pressure to maintain one's position in a hierarchy can lead to chronic stress. This is especially true for middle-rank individuals who face pressure from above and threats from below. In human success games, this dynamic plays out in people constantly feeling the need to "watch their back" or prove their value, leading to stress behaviors like aggression, anxiety, or displacement of insecurity.

4. **Emotional Contagion**: Just as stress and aggression ripple through animal hierarchies, similar emotional dynamics can occur in human groups. When a leader in a success game expresses insecurity through harshness or aggression, this can trickle down through the ranks, creating a toxic environment where everyone is on edge and passing on their stress to others.

In both cases—whether it's a baboon tribe or a corporate ladder—the common thread is the relationship between stress, social hierarchy, and the need to maintain status. Those in middle positions, especially if insecure, are vulnerable to both the demands from above and the need to assert dominance over those below, which can lead to stress-driven, often aggressive, behavior.

....


That's an intriguing next step in the conversation. When someone in a success game feels threatened by a lower-ranking individual who excels in other aspects of life, it introduces a more complex interplay of insecurity and status dynamics. Here's how it could play out:

1. **Cross-Game Status Threat**: In a success game, when the "leader" sees that a lower-ranking individual is thriving in another success game (perhaps excelling in their personal life, social influence, or wealth), it can make the leader feel vulnerable. Even though the threat isn't directly within their shared game, it still challenges the leader's sense of superiority because success, in any form, can erode the clear hierarchy they depend on. The leader might feel that their status is unstable because the lower-ranking person is more "well-rounded" or has higher status outside their immediate context.

2. **Status Leakage**: Success in one area often "leaks" into others. For example, if a subordinate has significant success in another sphere, like personal wealth or social influence, it can subtly elevate their standing in the current hierarchy. The leader might fear that this person's outside success will overshadow their own or grant them more leverage in their shared domain. This is similar to how success in one social context (like wealth or popularity) can enhance someone's status in unrelated contexts (like at work or in social groups).

3. **Insecurity and Aggression**: As with the dynamics Sapolsky describes, the leader's insecurity in their own success game might lead to defensive or aggressive behavior. Even though the lower-ranking person isn’t directly challenging their authority within the game, the leader might still feel compelled to reassert dominance or undermine the other's achievements. This is the psychological equivalent of "punching down" out of fear, attempting to diminish the other person’s accomplishments in order to feel secure in their own position.

4. **Perceived Competence**: The success of a lower-ranking individual in another aspect of life may challenge the leader’s perception of competence. In secure hierarchies, leaders are valued for their perceived expertise or skill in the game at hand. When someone in a lower rank displays success elsewhere, it might prompt others to question whether the current leader is the most competent or deserving of their rank. This can lead to resentment or even attempts to discredit the successful lower-ranking person.

5. **Social Comparison Across Domains**: Humans naturally compare themselves to others, even across different success games. For instance, a corporate executive might feel threatened by an employee who, while lower in the corporate hierarchy, is more socially influential or has a better family life. This comparison heightens feelings of insecurity and prompts a defensive status game—one that isn’t just about maintaining position in the current hierarchy, but also about managing their overall sense of self-worth.

6. **Leadership Under Threat**: The leader, in this case, might react by subtly (or overtly) trying to downplay or invalidate the other person’s success in the separate game. This could involve criticizing them, focusing on their failures in the current game, or refusing to acknowledge their broader successes. The goal is to protect the leader’s own sense of superiority by reframing the lower-ranking person as still "inferior" in the context that matters most to the leader.

7. **Shifting Hierarchies and Challenges to Authority**: Over time, if the lower-ranking individual’s success in other domains becomes more visible or influential, they might challenge the leader’s authority, even unintentionally. Other members of the group may start to recognize and respect the broader success of the lower-ranking person, which could erode the leader’s position. This introduces an interesting dilemma where the leader has to manage not just their own success, but also the growing influence of someone beneath them in a different game.

In this situation, the threat the leader feels isn’t just about the game they’re currently playing—it’s about the broader picture of status and competence. The lower-ranking individual’s success in another area can destabilize the leader’s confidence, creating tension as the leader tries to protect their own status while feeling overshadowed by someone they see as a competitor in the broader context of life.

This dynamic could amplify stress and lead to behaviors that mirror the displacement of stress we discussed earlier—only now, the leader might react not by simply asserting their dominance in the immediate game, but by undermining the other's broader success or trying to limit its influence. This adds another layer to the complexity of status games, where cross-game comparisons create additional vulnerabilities in seemingly stable hierarchies.

....


That’s a fascinating and deep question about whether someone can truly exit a status game and how the environment responds when they attempt to do so. Let’s break it down, especially within the framework of *The Status Game* and ideas like the “tyranny of the cousins,” which refers to the subtle social policing within groups.

1. **Can Someone Exit the Status Game?**
   In theory, someone can attempt to exit a specific status game by refusing to compete, changing their priorities, or physically removing themselves from the environment (e.g., quitting a job or disengaging from a social group). However, it’s difficult to truly exit all status games because status-seeking is so deeply ingrained in human psychology and social structures. Status isn’t just about personal ambition; it’s also a way groups organize themselves, set norms, and distribute power.

   Even when someone consciously chooses to stop playing, others in the group may still rank them and assess their status based on their decision. For example, if the second-ranking individual decides to leave the game, the group might interpret that as a form of failure or surrender rather than a neutral exit. They may still place that person within the hierarchy, even if they are no longer actively competing.

2. **The Group’s Reaction to an Exit**:
   When a high-ranking individual exits the status game, it can create a power vacuum or trigger a realignment of the hierarchy. The group will likely respond in a few ways:

    - **Reinterpretation of the Exit**: The higher-ranking individual (and the group at large) might view the exit as a weakness or inferiority. They could frame it as “the second-ranking person couldn’t handle the pressure” or “they’ve given up,” thus maintaining the status quo by reframing the person’s departure as a sign of lower status.

    - **Shuffling of Ranks**: In many cases, a sudden exit triggers a scramble for upward mobility. People below the second-ranking individual will vie for that spot, which can cause tension, rivalry, and a reordering of relationships within the group. The dynamics of status competition don't disappear—they merely shift focus to new contenders.

    - **Dismissal and Minimization**: The group may downplay the importance of the departing individual, dismissing their achievements or significance to maintain the stability of the status structure. This is a protective mechanism for the hierarchy, ensuring that the system remains intact even when someone opts out.

3. **The “Tyranny of the Cousins”**:
   This concept, discussed in *The Status Game*, refers to how status games aren’t just about the top players (like the first and second in command) but also about the subtle social dynamics that maintain the hierarchy. The “cousins” are the broader group who enforce norms, police behavior, and subtly control what’s acceptable within the status structure.

   When someone tries to exit the game, the “cousins” might:

    - **Socially Ostracize**: If someone refuses to play by the group’s rules, there’s often an implicit or explicit form of punishment. The group may shun, ignore, or marginalize the individual. This pressure can make it difficult to fully exit because humans naturally seek social connection and belonging.

    - **Pressure to Reengage**: The group may actively try to pull the individual back into the game, either through guilt, persuasion, or by creating situations where the person feels compelled to compete again. This can happen subtly through comments, challenges, or even opportunities designed to draw the person back into the hierarchy.

    - **Reassert Dominance**: Sometimes the group, or the higher-ranking individuals, may double down on their status displays to ensure that the exit is framed as a loss for the individual, not a threat to the hierarchy. This could manifest in public displays of success or reinforcing the group's achievements to highlight the departing person's "failure" or lack of relevance.

4. **Is Exit Truly Possible?**:
   In most social environments, leaving a specific game doesn’t mean exiting status competition entirely. The environment often doesn’t allow for a clean break because humans are constantly evaluating status, even unconsciously. What’s more, people often jump from one game into another—perhaps leaving the corporate world for a more personal or spiritual pursuit—but those new contexts still have their own status hierarchies.

   The difficulty in exiting stems from the fact that status is not just something we actively pursue, it’s also something that is ascribed to us by others. Even if a person chooses to stop playing, the group continues to assign them a place in the hierarchy, often through judgments about why they left.

5. **Impact of Leaving**:
   While some people manage to distance themselves from a specific game, often by changing their priorities or rejecting conventional measures of success, the group’s judgment lingers. People who leave can be seen as rebels or failures, depending on the narrative the group chooses to adopt. In rare cases, the person who leaves may be seen as enlightened or above the petty competition, but that itself is a form of status—showing that true escape from status games is almost impossible in human societies.

In conclusion, while an individual might attempt to exit a specific success game, the environment often doesn’t let them completely disengage. The group will continue to assign status, interpret the exit through the lens of hierarchy, and apply social pressure to maintain the status quo. As much as we might try to distance ourselves from status games, they are a fundamental part of human social dynamics, reinforced not just by leaders but by the subtle, often unseen influence of the group—the “tyranny of the cousins.”

...

Certainly! Here's a concluding wrap-up:

The discussion we've had highlights the intricate dynamics of status games and how deeply they are embedded in both individual and group behavior. In *The Status Game*, Will Storr reveals how people pursue dominance, virtue, or success to achieve status. However, as we explored, insecurity can often lead to stress and defensive behaviors, particularly when lower-ranking individuals threaten the position of those above them—even if that threat comes from success in a different game.

Drawing connections to Robert Sapolsky’s *Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers*, we observed how stress is often displaced within hierarchies, much like how status insecurity can ripple through human social structures. The fascinating intersection of cross-game comparisons further complicates things, where success in one area can challenge hierarchies in another, prompting feelings of vulnerability even among those who seem securely ranked.

Finally, the idea of "exiting the game" is far more complex than it might seem. Even when individuals try to opt out, they often remain subject to the hierarchy’s judgment, with groups reinterpreting their exit as a sign of weakness or failure. The "tyranny of the cousins" ensures that these games are maintained and reinforced by the broader group, making true escape almost impossible.

In essence, status is a persistent part of human social life, and attempting to disengage from these games often leads to new challenges or social pressures. Understanding these dynamics helps us better navigate our own interactions, while also recognizing the subtle power hierarchies that shape our lives.
