The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) has **12** top-level requirements. While
the sources don't explicitly state the number of requirements in PCI DSS, they do mention that PCI
DSS compliance is essential for organizations involved in credit card processing. They also mention
that Visa, a major credit card company, has established procedures and timelines for reporting and
responding to data compromise events.

### Overview Note: PCI DSS

* **Purpose:** Created to enhance the security of credit card data and protect against theft and
  fraud.
* **Scope:** Applies to all organizations that store, process, or transmit credit card information.
* **Compliance:** Although voluntary, PCI DSS compliance is mandatory for entities participating in
  credit card processing networks.
* **Enforcement:** Primarily enforced through contractual agreements with payment card brands like
  Visa and Mastercard.
* **Key Requirements:** Encompasses a range of security controls, including network security, data
  encryption, vulnerability management, access control, monitoring, and incident response.
* **Data Retention:** While the specific requirements for data retention are not mentioned in the
  sources, they are likely addressed within the broader framework of PCI DSS.
* **Incident Response:** The sources highlight the importance of incident response in the context of
  PCI DSS, specifically referencing Visa's requirements for reporting and responding to data
  compromises.

*Please note that this overview note is based on the information available in the sources provided
and my general knowledge. To get a comprehensive understanding of the 12 requirements of PCI DSS,
you should refer to the official PCI Security Standards Council documentation.*
