## ASHRAE

ASHRAE recommends maintaining a temperature range between 64.4°F to 80.6°F (18°C to 27°C) for
optimal operation of data center equipment. Temperatures above this range may increase the risk of
overheating, equipment failure, and reduced lifespan of hardware components.


### Weak Points


`Revise`
* **Homomorphic encryption** is a form of encryption that allows computations to be performed
  directly on
  encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first. The results of these computations, when
  decrypted, match the results of operations as if they had been performed on the original,
  unencrypted data. This property makes homomorphic encryption particularly useful in scenarios
  where
  data privacy is critical, such as secure cloud computing, confidential data analysis, and
  privacy-preserving machine learning.

`Revise`
* **Asymmetric encryption**, also known as public-key encryption, is a type of encryption that uses
  a pair of keys — a public key and a private key — to secure data. The public key is openly shared
  and can be used by anyone to encrypt data, while the private key is kept secret and is used to
  decrypt the data. This approach ensures that only the intended recipient, who possesses the
  corresponding private key, can access the original information.

`Revise`
* **SSMS Secret Sharing** allows users to securely store and manage sensitive information like
  passwords, connection strings, or keys directly in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). This can
  be achieved through the SQL Server's Credential Management feature or by using the Azure Key Vault
  integration for enhanced security.

`Revise`

* **An IaaS service** model allows an organization to retain the most control of their IT assets in the
  cloud; the cloud customer is responsible for the operating system, the applications, and the data
  in the cloud. The private cloud model allows the organization to retain the greatest degree of
  governance control in the cloud; all the other deployment models would necessitate giving up
  governance control in an environment with pooled resources.

`Revise`
* **“unvalidated redirects and forwards.”** - Train users to recognize invalidated links.
* Oddly enough, this may be a good topic to explain during user training; when an attacker is trying
  to conduct an attack by exploiting unvalidated redirects and forwards, it is often in conjunction
  with a social engineering/phishing aspect. Users trained to recognize social engineering/phishing
  indicators might be able to avoid susceptibility to these attacks.

`Revise`

The framework categorizes controls into families such as Access Control, Incident Response, and Risk
Assessment, and includes mechanisms like baselines, assessment procedures, and control enhancements.
NIST 800-53 emphasizes key principles such as least privilege, audit and accountability, and
contingency planning to ensure robust security postures. The controls are designed to be scalable
and adaptable, applicable not only to federal systems but also to private sector organizations
seeking to align with best practices for information security and privacy.

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is a multinational entity that
creates nonbinding policy suggestions for its member countries. The OECD has published
recommendations for privacy laws

* **NIST** - **NIST 800-53** is a comprehensive framework developed by the National Institute of
  Standards and Technology (NIST) to provide guidelines for selecting and implementing security and
  privacy controls in federal information systems and organizations. Part of the NIST Special
  Publication 800 series, it supports compliance with the Federal Information Security Modernization
  Act (FISMA) and aims to protect government data and infrastructure by detailing a set of security
  controls to manage risk effectively.

`Revise`

**Two-factor authentication (2FA)** requires two different forms of verification from separate categories:

1. Something you know (like a password or PIN)
2. Something you have (like a security token or mobile device)
3. Something you are (like biometric data, such as fingerprints or facial recognition)
