When developing a Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP), the following order should be followed:

Project management and initiation
Conduct a Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
Develop recovery strategies
Develop the documentation
Implement the plan
Test the plan
Report and revise
Embed the plan in the user community
As they have just developed the plan in this scenario, the next step is to implement it. The instinct for most people is to move to test the plan so that it can then be implemented. Since these are the steps to be taken after significant failure, it is necessary to build the alternative cloud to fail into before you can test it.
