ISO/IEC 27018 is a standard privacy requirement for cloud service providers to adhere to. It is
focused on five key principals: communication, consent, control, transparency, and independent and
yearly audits. ISO/IEC 27018 is for cloud providers acting as Data Processors handling Personally
Identifiable Information (PII). (A major clue in the question is cloud providers.)


## What is ISO/IEC 270018?

ISO/IEC 270018 is an international standard that offers a code of practice for safeguarding personally identifiable information (PII) in public cloud computing environments. It extends the principles of ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002, which focus on information security management, to address the specific privacy challenges inherent in cloud computing.

This standard is particularly relevant for public cloud providers who act as PII processors, meaning they handle personal data on behalf of their customers (the data controllers). It outlines guidelines for cloud providers to enhance their security controls and practices to ensure the privacy and protection of their customers' data.

Here are some key aspects of ISO/IEC 270018:

*   **Focus on Public Cloud Environments:** The standard specifically addresses the unique privacy risks and considerations associated with public cloud services. It recognizes the shared responsibility model in cloud computing and provides recommendations for both cloud providers and customers.

*   **Alignment with Existing Security Standards:** ISO/IEC 270018 builds upon the established framework of ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002, ensuring consistency and integration with broader information security management systems.

*   **Protection of PII:** The primary objective of ISO/IEC 270018 is to protect personally identifiable information handled by cloud providers. It outlines best practices for data security, access control, encryption, and other measures to mitigate privacy risks.

*   **Guidance for Cloud Providers and Customers:** The standard offers recommendations for both cloud service providers and their customers. This helps to clarify roles and responsibilities in protecting PII and promotes a collaborative approach to privacy management.

*   **International Recognition:** As an ISO/IEC standard, ISO/IEC 270018 carries international weight and recognition. This can be valuable for cloud providers seeking to demonstrate their commitment to data privacy and build trust with customers globally.

While not legally binding in all jurisdictions, ISO/IEC 270018 can serve as a valuable framework for cloud providers to enhance their privacy practices, comply with relevant regulations, and provide assurances to customers about the protection of their sensitive data.
