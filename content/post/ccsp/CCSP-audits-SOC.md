### Including GAPP?
The **Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP)** is a privacy framework with ten principles that
can be included as part of a SOC audit. The AICPA (American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants) and the CICA (Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants) developed these principles
with input from experts.

The sources provide a detailed explanation of each GAPP principle, highlighting their relevance to
privacy management.

The ten GAPP principles are:

1. **Management:**  The entity defines, documents, communicates, and assigns accountability for its
   privacy policies and procedures.

2. **Notice:** The entity provides notice about its privacy policies and procedures and identifies
   the purposes for which personal information is collected, used, retained, and disclosed.

3. **Choice and Consent:** The entity describes the choices available to the individual and obtains
   implicit or explicit consent relating to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal
   information.

4. **Collection:** The entity collects personal information only for the purposes identified in the
   notice and with the consent of the individual or as required by law.

5. **Use, Retention, and Disposal:** The entity limits the use of personal information to the
   purposes identified in the notice and for which consent was obtained. The entity retains personal
   information for only as long as necessary to fulfill the stated purposes or as required by law
   and disposes of personal information securely.

6. **Access:** The entity provides individuals with access to their personal information for review
   and update.

7. **Disclosure to Third Parties:** The entity discloses personal information to third parties only
   for the purposes identified in the notice and with the consent of the individual or as required
   by law.

8. **Security for Privacy:** The entity protects personal information against unauthorized access,
   use, modification, disclosure, or destruction.

9. **Quality:** The entity maintains accurate, complete, and relevant personal information for the
   purposes identified in the notice.

10. **Monitoring and Enforcement:** The entity monitors compliance with its privacy policies and
    procedures and has procedures to address privacy-related complaints and disputes.

The sources highlight the importance of considering audit mechanisms when planning for a SOC audit,
particularly the collection and correlation of logs across different cloud environments. They also
mention that adapting existing audit processes for the cloud may be necessary due to limitations
like lack of direct access to hardware and the prevalence of shared services.

Since the sources don't directly state that GAPP can be explicitly included in a SOC audit, it's
advisable to clarify this point with an auditor or seek further information on specific SOC audit
requirements related to privacy frameworks.
