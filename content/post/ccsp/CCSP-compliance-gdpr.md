GDPR is a European Union requirement for member states to have a law to protect the personal data of
natural persons.

## General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): A Brief Overview

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection law enacted by the
European Union (EU) that came into effect in 2018. While originating in the EU, the GDPR has
significant implications for organizations worldwide, especially those handling personal data of EU
residents.

Here's a breakdown of key GDPR aspects based on the sources provided:

**1. Broad Scope and Applicability:**

* **Protection of Personal Data:** The GDPR aims to safeguard all personal data relating to
  individuals within the EU. This encompasses any information that can directly or indirectly
  identify a person, such as names, addresses, online identifiers, and even location data.

* **Global Reach:** The GDPR's territorial scope extends beyond the physical borders of the EU. It
  applies to any organization, regardless of location, that processes personal data of EU residents
  in the course of offering goods or services or monitoring their behaviour within the EU. This
  means that even companies based outside the EU may need to comply with GDPR if they handle data of
  EU individuals.

* **Data Controllers and Processors:** The GDPR distinguishes between data controllers and data
  processors. A data controller determines the purposes and means of processing personal data, while
  a data processor handles the data on behalf of the controller. Both controllers and processors
  have obligations and liabilities under the GDPR, ensuring comprehensive data protection throughout
  the processing chain.

**2. Core Principles and Individual Rights:**

* **Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency:** Personal data processing must be lawful, fair, and
  transparent. Individuals have the right to be informed about how their data is collected, used,
  and shared.

* **Purpose Limitation:** Data collection must be limited to specified, explicit, and legitimate
  purposes. Organizations cannot use personal data for purposes other than those for which it was
  originally collected without obtaining further consent.

* **Data Minimization:** Organizations should only collect and process the minimum amount of
  personal data necessary for the intended purpose.

* **Accuracy:** Personal data must be accurate and kept up to date. Individuals have the right to
  request rectification of inaccurate data.

* **Storage Limitation:** Personal data should be stored only for as long as necessary for the
  specified purpose.

* **Integrity and Confidentiality:** Data processing must ensure appropriate security of personal
  data, including protection against unauthorized access, processing, or disclosure.

* **Accountability:** Data controllers are responsible for demonstrating compliance with GDPR
  principles.

**3. Enhanced Individual Rights:**

* **Right to Access:** Individuals have the right to access their personal data held by
  organizations and obtain confirmation of whether their data is being processed.

* **Right to Rectification:** Individuals can request correction of inaccurate or incomplete
  personal data.

* **Right to Erasure ('Right to be Forgotten'):**  In certain circumstances, individuals have the
  right to request deletion of their personal data. This right is particularly relevant when the
  data is no longer necessary for the original purpose, consent is withdrawn, or the processing is
  unlawful.

* **Right to Restriction of Processing:** Individuals can request limitations on data processing in
  specific situations, such as when the accuracy of the data is contested or the processing is
  unlawful.

* **Right to Data Portability:** Individuals have the right to receive their personal data in a
  structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. This allows them to easily transfer their
  data to another controller.

* **Right to Object:** Individuals can object to data processing based on legitimate interests or
  direct marketing.

**4. International Data Transfers:**

* **Adequacy Decisions:** The EU can issue adequacy decisions for countries with data protection
  laws deemed to provide an adequate level of protection comparable to the GDPR. This allows for
  free data flow between the EU and these countries. However, the US currently does not have an
  adequacy decision.

* **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs):**  Organizations can use SCCs, pre-approved by the European
  Commission, to ensure adequate data protection when transferring data to countries without
  adequacy decisions.

* **Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs):** Multinational companies can implement BCRs, internal data
  protection policies that meet GDPR requirements, to govern data transfers within their corporate
  group.

* **Derogations:** The GDPR permits limited exceptions, known as derogations, for data transfers
  outside the EU in specific circumstances, such as when explicit consent is obtained or the
  transfer is necessary for contractual obligations.

**5. Enforcement and Penalties:**

* **Supervisory Authorities:** Each EU member state has a supervisory authority responsible for
  enforcing the GDPR.

* **Penalties:** Organizations that violate the GDPR can face significant fines, up to â‚¬20 million
  or 4% of annual global turnover, whichever is higher, depending on the nature and severity of the
  infringement.
