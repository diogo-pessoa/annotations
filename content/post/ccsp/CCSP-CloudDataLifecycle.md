## **C**reate, **S**tore, **U**se, **S**hare, **A**rchive, **D**estroy

The Cloud Data Lifecycle is a framework that helps to understand and manage data throughout its
existence in a cloud environment.

### 1. Create

The data creation phase involves generating or receiving new data. This can be done through manual
input, automatic system creation, data transfers, or transactions.

#### Security Considerations

##### Data Classification

Properly classify data according to its sensitivity and importance (e.g., public, confidential,
secret).

##### Access Controls

Ensure appropriate access controls are applied to the newly created data.

##### Encryption

Consider encrypting data at creation if it is sensitive or confidential.

##### Logging and Monitoring

Track who creates data, when, and where, to maintain accountability and traceability.

### 2. Store

The storage phase involves saving the data in a persistent storage location, such as a
database, file system, or cloud storage service.

##### Security Considerations

##### Encryption at Rest

Encrypt data to protect it from unauthorized access while stored.

##### Data Integrity

Implement mechanisms to ensure data integrity, such as checksums or digital
signatures.

###### Access Control

Apply least privilege and need-to-know principles to access stored data.

###### Redundancy and Backup

Ensure redundancy, backup, and recovery processes are in place to prevent
data loss.

### 3. Use

This phase involves accessing, processing, or analyzing the data to achieve a specific
purpose.

#### Security Considerations

##### Data Encryption in Use

Use encryption methods like homomorphic encryption or secure multi-party
computation to protect data while it's being processed.

##### Access Control and Authentication

Enforce strong authentication and authorization policies for data
access.

##### Monitoring and Auditing

Monitor data access and usage patterns to detect and prevent unauthorized
use.

##### Data Masking and Anonymization

Use data masking, anonymization, or tokenization techniques to
protect sensitive data. [TODO - Add link to data masking]

### 4. Share

The sharing phase occurs when data is distributed to different users, systems, or organizations.

#### Security Considerations

##### Encryption in Transit

Encrypt data during transmission using secure protocols (e.g., TLS, SSL).

##### Access Controls

Ensure that only authorized parties have access to the shared data.

##### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

Implement DLP solutions to prevent unauthorized sharing or leakage.

##### Data Handling Policies

Enforce policies governing how shared data should be handled by recipients.

### 5. Archive

The archiving phase involves moving data to long-term storage for retention purposes.

* Keep archived data encrypted to protect it from unauthorized access.
* Have Policies for data archiving that include considerations about legal data retention and
  deletion requirements and the rotation of encryption keys used to protect long-lived sensitive
  data.
* Maintain strict access controls to archived data, ensuring only authorized personnel can retrieve
  or
  restore it.

### 6. Destroy

The destruction phase involves permanently deleting or disposing of data that is no
longer needed.

* Apply Secure erasure
* Enforce data destruction policies to comply with legal and regulatory
  requirements.
* Audit trail of data destruction activities to provide proof of compliance.
* Ensure that any third-party service providers handling data destruction
  adhere to secure practices.

{{% notice info "Cryptographic erasure" %}}
Cryptographic erasure is a method of data destruction where encryption keys are deleted, rendering
the encrypted data unreadable and effectively destroyed.

#### Other considerations

In regard to `data sanitization`, Consider the service Model when anlying each approach.

* **SaaS** requires special consideration for data sanitization due to data interconnectivity. Since
  SaaS providers manage the entire infrastructure and application, data destruction relies on
  contractual requirements. Therefore, customers should ensure their contracts with SaaS providers
  clearly outline data sanitization processes.
* **PaaS**  also presents difficulties with data sanitization because customers do not typically
  have access to the underlying infrastructure.
  The specifics of data sanitization in a PaaS environment will depend on the software design and
  data storage mechanisms chosen by the provider. Customers should therefore carefully consider the
  data lifecycle, including destruction, when choosing a PaaS provider and negotiating contracts.
* **IaaS** often allocates virtual hard drives to specific virtual machines, which simplifies  
  data sanitization. Customers have more control over their environments in IaaS, making
  crypto-shredding a more straightforward process.

**DBaaS** is likely to handle data sanitization similarly to IaaS. Customers will need to rely 
on the
provider's processes for data destruction, often implemented through crypto-shredding.
