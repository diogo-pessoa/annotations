**Tim Minchin**

>You've gotta keep it simple
Life is like a song
There are tunes that folk are used to
So if you want 'em to sing along
Just keep it simple

>You oughta play it safe
Life is just a game
People like the rules as written
So just give 'em more of the same

>No one likes a smart-arse (No one likes a smart-arse)
No one likes it complicated (You've gotta keep it simple)
If you want to go the distance
Find the path of least resistance
And just take it

>You don't want to stick your neck out (You don't want to stick your neck out)
They'll take your head off if you do (They're gonna rip your head off)
Just sit up the back and judge others (Hey, sit down!)
It'll keep 'em from judging you

>If you're too hard to stomach you'll never amount to nothing
Ain't that something?
No one cares what you have to say
Just shut up and play the role you're cast in (You've got to play the role you're cast in)

>You see, all the world's a stage
So just say the lines you're given
Exactly as they're written
And for God's sake
Act your age

>No one likes a show-off (No one likes a show-off)
No one likes a clown
Just make sure you don't stand out in the crowd
That way they can't cut you down
You gotta build your walls around you (Build your walls around you)
You build them straight and make 'em square (Build them straight and square)
That way you'll blend in with the background
That way no one will point and stare (No one will point and stare)

>You gotta stick to your convictions (Stick to your convictions!)
You gotta nail down your views (Nail 'em down)
You wanna steer clear of the discomfort you feel
When you walk in another person's shoes (You don't need that!)

>You gotta work out who your team is
Then wear the badge with pride
Find a box that makes ya comfortable
And then stay the heck inside

>On the first day the Lord gave you television (Lord gave you television)
On the next he delivered a couch (He delivers)
Tell me how do you explain all this content
If the universe wanted you out and about

>Toe the line
Don your suit
Hide your truth
Wipe your tears
Don't cause trouble
Find your bubble
Stick to black-and-white ideas
Play it safe
Know your place
Know your lines
Know your limits
Find a doctrine
Get it locked in
Build a box and stay in it

>Toe the line
Don your suit
Hide your truth
Wipe your tears
Don't cause trouble
Find your bubble
Stick to black-and-white ideas
Play it safe
Keep it beige
Keep it simple and sameish
Leave the weird ideas to the Danish (To the weird old Danish)

>You gotta play it safe
Your mind is like a house
If you keep it locked up tight
You just might keep the world out
