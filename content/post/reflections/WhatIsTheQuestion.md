When revisiting the nature of scientific discovery, it is essential to remember that **the question is often more
important than the answer**. Both Richard Feynman and the authors of "What is the Question?" suggest that our
understanding of the world is shaped not just by facts, but by the **frameworks** we use to query reality.

## 1. The Infinite Regress of "Why"

Feynman famously illustrated that "why" is a difficult question because it is a moving target. If you ask why Aunt
Minnie is in the hospital, the answer could involve a slipped hip, the slipperiness of ice, the expansion of water
molecules, or the fundamental nature of electrical forces.

* **The Lesson:** To get a satisfying answer, you must stay within a **framework where you allow certain things to be "
  true"** or "known".
* **The Trap:** Explaining the unfamiliar using the familiar can be "cheating". For example, explaining magnets using "
  rubber bands" is misleading because the tension in rubber bands is actually caused by the very electrical forces you
  are trying to explain.

## Day Science vs. Night Science

The sources distinguish between two modes of scientific thought:

* **Day Science:** This is the "highroad of progress" where we work with **fixed targets** to solve puzzles and fill
  in "knowledge gaps" in the existing "brick wall" of science.
* **Night Science:** This is the "unpredictable and wandering process" where we **generate new ideas** and discover "
  unknown unknowns". It is often an "illogical leap into the unknown".

## Finding the "Cloud"

When you feel lost in a project, you are likely in **"the cloud"**.

* Uri Alon’s concept of the cloud describes the state where you have lost your original goal (Point B) and are wandering
  in confusion.
* **The Insight:** Instead of being a sign of failure, the cloud is a **hallmark of significant work**. It is from
  within this confusion that you might discover a new, transformative question (Point C).

## The Power of Reframing

A major discovery is typically both the **solution and the birth of a new problem**. Breakthroughs rarely come from
answering broad, community-generated questions (like "What is the origin of life?") but from **refocusing** them into
something testable.

* **The CRISPR Example:** Instead of asking generally why bacteria have these elements, Francisco Mojica asked a
  specific, refocused question: "What does the **similarity of the spacers to known DNA sequences** tell us about their
  function?".
* **The Erasure Effect:** Once a new question reframes reality, it often "erases its own origin," making the new
  perspective seem obvious in hindsight.

## Summary for Future Self

* **Embrace uncertainty:** Science is the "art of dealing with things we do not know enough about".
* **Check your framework:** Are you asking a question that requires a deeper level of physics or logic than your current
  framework allows?.
* **Value the question:** Posing the right question is a credit to a scientist even if their initial answer is wrong.
* **Stop "cheating":** Don't use familiar analogies that are actually powered by the very phenomenon you are trying to
  explain.
