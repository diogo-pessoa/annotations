> “How do you feel when you wake up and when you get into bed at night, and how easily do you fall asleep?” The time in
> bed in the morning and at night tells you all you need to know. It’s not purely intellectual reasoning. It’s not a
> pro-and-con list. It’s not a spreadsheet. It’s not a Venn diagram. How do you feel? Are you even aware of how you’re
> feeling? How much energy have you spent blocking out certain feelings because you don’t want to feel certain things?
> To borrow from Tara Brach: “There was a wise old sage who said, ‘There’s really only one question worth considering, and
> that is: What are you unwilling to feel?’”
> Do you wake up with a sense of foreboding and anxiety and a desire to stay in bed? When you go to bed, are you full of
> anxiety and worries and preoccupation about what happened, or what could happen the next day? I use this question as a
> systems check-in for identifying things I should stop, lessen, or double down on.



> “Things turn out best for the people who make the best of the way things turn out.”
> — John Wooden.
