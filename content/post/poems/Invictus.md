## William Ernest Henley
`1849 â€“ 1903`

Out of the night that covers me,<br>
Black as the Pit from pole to pole,<br>
I thank whatever gods may be<br>
For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance<br>
I have not winced nor cried aloud.<br>
Under the bludgeoning of chance<br>
My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br>
Looms but the Horror of the shade,<br>
And yet the menace of the years<br>
Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.<br>

It matters not how strait the gate,<br>
How charged with punishments the scroll,<br>
I am the master of my fate<br>
I am the captain of my soul.
