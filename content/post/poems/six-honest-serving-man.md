Rudyard Kipling

I keep six honest serving-men<br>
(They taught me all I knew);<br>
Their names are What and Why and When<br>
And How and Where and Who.<br>
I send them over land and sea,<br>
I send them east and west;<br>
But after they have worked for me,<br>
I give them all a rest.<br>

I let them rest from nine till five,<br>
For I am busy then,<br>
As well as breakfast, lunch, and tea,<br>
For they are hungry men.<br>
But different folk have different views;<br>
I know a person small—<br>
She keeps ten million serving-men,<br>
Who get no rest at all!<br>
<br>
She sends'em abroad on her own affairs,<br>
From the second she opens her eyes—<br>
One million **Hows**, two million **Wheres**,<br>
And seven million **Whys**!<br>
