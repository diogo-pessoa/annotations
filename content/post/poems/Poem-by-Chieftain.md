`Which book I saw this?`  

So live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart.<br> 
Trouble no one about their religion; respect others in their view, and demand that they respect yours.<br> 
Love your life, perfect your life, beautify all things in your life.<br> 
Seek to make your life long and its purpose in the service of your people.<br> 
Prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divide.<br>
Always give a word or a sign of salute when meeting or passing a friend, even a stranger, when in a lonely place.<br> 
Show respect to all people and grovel to none.<br>
<br>
When you arise in the morning give thanks for the food and for the joy of living.<br> 
If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only in yourself.<br>
Abuse no one and nothing, for abuse turns the wise ones to fools and robs the spirit of its vision.<br>

When it comes your time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear of death,<br> 
so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way.<br>
Sing your death song and die like a hero going home.” — Chief Tecumseh
