— Roger Ebert, “Go gentle into that good
night.”, [RogerEbert.com](https://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/go-gentle-into-that-good-night)

> “I believe that if, at the end of it all, according to our abilities, we have done something to make others a little
> happier, and something to make ourselves a little happier, that is about the best we can do. To make others less happy
> is a crime. To make ourselves unhappy is where all crime starts. We must try to contribute joy to the world. That is
> true no matter what our problems, our health, our circumstances. We must try.”


Interestingly, the above is inspired by a quotation:

From **Brendan Behan** on the wall, and under it this quotation, which I memorized:

>“I respect kindness in human beings first of all, and kindness to animals.I don’t respect the law; I have a total
irreverence for anything connected with society except that which makes the roads safer, the beer stronger, the food
cheaper and the old men and old women warmer in the winter and happier in the summer.”
