Collective understanding of intelligence comes before any language representation.

Somebody's action, would it make as feel?

Not directly. The individual Interpret, process and then feels.

A brain only "knows" is sees, once the eyes are exposed to light (Perception). Observation, then
meaning. The meaning (context) added will come from previous experiences. `(Much like a model, predicts based on training set)`

`(I belive I came across the idea above from Quand La machine apprend â€“ Yan LeCun)`

Also heard the concept from Edward Gibson (Fridman podcast) and references to Chomsky
