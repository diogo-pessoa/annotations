Economics is the study of Incentives (Incentives vs Goals)

Why companies fails and projects are delayed?

Often due to misaligned incentives.

- Executives are motivated by short term results to increase their end-of-year bonus.
- Middle level management is motivated by the need to keep their job and stay on the executive good
  side. While keeping making sure their employee are visible and generating the wanted numbers.
- Employees are motivated by the need to maxime their Income. Having said that, employee aren't paid
  by their output. They're paid to show up and be in the office 40 hours a week. Stock award
  programs are time based, not performance based. The longer you stay in the company the more stocks
  vest. It's in the employee interest to stay in the company as long as possible, looking busy is
  and generating the expected numbers is the optimal strategy.

Another idea from Thomas Sowell:

* Rent control will lead to destruction of real state market in a city


---

Thomas Sowell, an American economist and social theorist, has extensively critiqued rent control policies in his writings, arguing that they cause significant damage to real estate markets in cities. Sowell's main points against rent control include:

1. **Supply and Demand Distortion**:
   - Sowell argues that rent control disrupts the natural balance of supply and demand in the housing market. By capping rents, landlords are discouraged from investing in or maintaining rental properties, leading to a decline in the overall quality and quantity of available housing.

2. **Reduced Incentives for Maintenance and Upgrades**:
   - Rent control reduces the financial incentives for landlords to maintain and upgrade properties. When rents are artificially kept low, landlords may find it economically unviable to invest in property improvements, resulting in deteriorating housing conditions.

3. **Black Markets and Illegal Payments**:
   - Sowell points out that rent control can lead to the creation of black markets and illegal payments. Tenants might offer under-the-table payments to secure rent-controlled apartments, undermining the policy's goal of providing affordable housing.

4. **Misallocation of Housing**:
   - Rent control can cause misallocation of housing, where people who might afford market-rate rents occupy rent-controlled units, while those in genuine need of affordable housing are left without options. This leads to inefficient use of housing resources.

5. **Decreased New Construction**:
   - Sowell emphasizes that rent control policies can deter new construction. Developers are less likely to invest in building new rental properties if they anticipate that their potential rental income will be limited by rent control regulations.

6. **Economic Inefficiency**:
   - Rent control, according to Sowell, leads to economic inefficiency by creating shortages and reducing the overall housing stock. This inefficiency can have broader negative effects on the urban economy, reducing mobility and limiting economic growth.

In his book "Basic Economics" and various articles, Sowell uses historical examples and empirical data to support his arguments. He often cites cases from cities like New York and San Francisco, where rent control has been implemented, to illustrate the negative consequences of such policies.

Overall, Thomas Sowell's perspective on rent control is that while it aims to make housing more affordable, it ultimately harms the housing market and the broader economy by creating distortions and inefficiencies.

Price Controls:

---
> Thomas Sowell has written extensively on economic topics, including the concepts of price controls
> and the unintended consequences they can have, often leading to what he describes as "artificial
> sabotage" of market mechanisms. Here is an overview of his views on these issues:

### Price Control

**1. Disruption of Supply and Demand**:

- Sowell argues that price controls, whether ceilings or floors, disrupt the natural equilibrium
  between supply and demand. When prices are set below the market level (price ceilings), shortages
  often result because the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied. Conversely, price floors
  can lead to surpluses where the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded.

**2. Reduction in Supply**:

- Price controls can disincentivize producers from supplying goods or services. For example, in the
  case of rent control, landlords might convert rental properties to other uses or avoid investing
  in maintenance and new construction, reducing the overall housing supply.

**3. Quality Deterioration**:

- Suppliers, facing reduced revenues due to price caps, might cut corners in quality. For instance,
  controlled prices can lead to lower quality goods, as producers attempt to maintain profitability
  despite constrained prices.

**4. Black Markets and Corruption**:

- Price controls often lead to the creation of black markets where goods are sold illegally at
  higher prices. This undermines the official market and can lead to widespread corruption as
  individuals and businesses seek to bypass regulations.

### Artificial Sabotage

**1. Economic Inefficiencies**:

- Sowell uses the term "artificial sabotage" to describe how government interventions, like price
  controls, can artificially disrupt the natural functioning of markets. This can result in
  inefficiencies where resources are not allocated in the most productive manner.

**2. Misallocation of Resources**:

- Interventions such as price controls can lead to resources being used less efficiently. For
  example, if rent is controlled below market rates, apartments might be occupied by those who could
  afford higher rents, while those in greater need struggle to find housing.

**3. Long-term Economic Damage**:

- Sowell posits that the long-term consequences of such interventions can be detrimental to economic
  growth and stability. Persistent shortages or surpluses can distort economic signals that guide
  investment and consumption decisions.

### Examples and Empirical Evidence

**1. Rent Control**:

- Sowell often references historical and contemporary examples of rent control in cities like New
  York and San Francisco. He argues that these policies have led to housing shortages, reduced
  quality of housing stock, and black market transactions.

**2. Agricultural Price Supports**:

- He also discusses agricultural price supports where government-set minimum prices for crops can
  lead to overproduction and waste, as seen in various agricultural policies around the world.

**3. Gasoline Price Controls**:

- Sowell has examined cases like the gasoline price controls in the United States during the 1970s,
  which led to long lines at gas stations and reduced availability, illustrating the broader
  economic inefficiencies induced by such policies.
### Summary

Thomas Sowell's critique of price controls and the concept of artificial sabotage highlights the
unintended negative consequences that can arise from well-intentioned but misguided economic
interventions. He argues that such policies often lead to shortages, reduced quality, black markets,
and overall economic inefficiency, ultimately harming the very individuals they aim to help. His
analysis is grounded in economic theory and supported by empirical examples from various sectors and
historical periods.
