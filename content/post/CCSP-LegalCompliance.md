## Legal

### The silver-platter doctrine

Was a principle in criminal procedure that allowed a federal court to use evidence obtained
illegally by a state police officer, as long as a federal officer did not participate in or request
the search.

### The doctrine of plain view

Allows law enforcement to act on probable cause when evidence of a crime is within their presence;
option A is incorrect.

### Doctrine of Property

* **The Doctrine of Property** refers to the legal principles and theories that govern the
  ownership, use,
  and transfer of property. It forms the foundation of property law, which deals with the rights,
  interests, and responsibilities associated with different types of property, such as real estate,
  personal property, and intellectual property. This doctrine encompasses a wide range of rules and
  concepts, developed over time, that define how property rights are created, enforced, and
  protected.

### GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act)

The Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, is a U.S. federal law that requires financial
institutions to explain their information-sharing practices to their customers and to protect
sensitive data. The GLBA was enacted to modernize and reform financial services regulation by
removing barriers that prevented the merger of banks, securities companies, and insurance firms.
However, it also includes provisions that mandate the protection of consumer financial information.

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

Is a comprehensive data protection law enacted by the European Union (EU) that came into effect on
May 25, 2018. It is designed to protect the privacy and personal data of individuals within the EU
and European Economic Area (EEA). GDPR sets strict guidelines for how organizations worldwide
collect, store, process, and transfer personal data of EU residents, providing individuals with
greater control over their data and imposing significant penalties for non-compliance.

#### Key Objectives of GDPR

1. **Strengthening Privacy Rights**:
    - GDPR enhances the privacy rights of individuals by providing them with greater control over
      their personal data, including rights to access, rectify, delete, and restrict the processing
      of their data.

2. **Harmonizing Data Protection Laws**:
    - GDPR harmonizes data protection laws across all EU member states, providing a single
      regulatory framework to simplify compliance for organizations operating in multiple EU
      countries.

3. **Ensuring Accountability and Compliance**:
    - GDPR mandates that organizations implement robust data protection measures, maintain records
      of processing activities, and demonstrate accountability for their data protection practices.

4. **Increasing Transparency**:
    - GDPR requires organizations to be transparent about how they collect, use, store, and share
      personal data, ensuring that individuals are fully informed about the processing of their
      data.

#### Key Principles of GDPR

GDPR is based on several key principles that guide how personal data should be processed:

1. **Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency**:
    - Personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently. Organizations must
      provide clear information about how they collect and use data and ensure they have a lawful
      basis for processing it.

2. **Purpose Limitation**:
    - Data must be collected for specific, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not processed
      further in a way incompatible with those purposes.

3. **Data Minimization**:
    - Only the minimum amount of personal data necessary for the intended purpose should be
      collected and processed.

4. **Accuracy**:
    - Personal data must be accurate and kept up to date. Inaccurate data should be corrected or
      deleted promptly.

5. **Storage Limitation**:
    - Personal data should not be kept longer than necessary for the purposes for which it was
      collected. Data must be securely deleted or anonymized when no longer needed.

6. **Integrity and Confidentiality (Security)**:
    - Personal data must be protected against unauthorized or unlawful processing, accidental loss,
      destruction, or damage. Organizations must implement appropriate technical and organizational
      security measures.

7. **Accountability**:
    - Organizations are responsible for ensuring compliance with GDPR and must be able to
      demonstrate their compliance with its principles and requirements.

#### Key Rights of Data Subjects under GDPR

      their behalf comply with GDPR requirements through contractual agreements and adequate
      safeguards.

#### Penalties for Non-Compliance

GDPR imposes strict penalties for non-compliance, which can be significant:

- **Tier 1 Fines**: Up to €10 million or 2% of the company's global annual revenue, whichever is
  higher, for violations related to internal record-keeping, data breaches, or not conducting impact
  assessments.
- **Tier 2 Fines**: Up to €20 million or 4% of the company's global annual revenue, whichever is
  higher, for violations related to data subject rights, consent requirements, data transfers, or
  data protection principles.

#### Benefits of GDPR Compliance

1. **Enhanced Trust and Reputation**:
    - Compliance with GDPR demonstrates a commitment to data protection, enhancing trust and
      confidence among customers, partners, and stakeholders.

standards for protecting the privacy and personal data of individuals within the EU. Organizations
that process the personal data of EU residents must comply with GDPR requirements to protect
individual rights, enhance data security, and avoid significant penalties.

## Rights Management

#### IRM/DRM

**IRM (Information Rights Management)** and **DRM (Digital Rights Management)** are technologies and
methodologies used to control and protect access to digital information and content. While both
serve to secure digital assets, they are applied in different contexts and have distinct purposes.

### Information Rights Management (IRM)

**Information Rights Management (IRM)** is a subset of digital rights management focused on
controlling access to sensitive information within organizations. IRM provides granular control over
who can access, view, edit, copy, print, or forward a document or piece of content, both within and
outside the organization.

#### Key Features of IRM:

1. **Access Control**: Allows document owners or administrators to define who can access specific
   information. Access can be managed by user roles, groups, or individual identities.
2. **Permissions Management**: Defines what actions users can perform on the document, such as view,
   edit, print, copy, or forward.
3. **Expiration and Revocation**: Enables setting expiration dates for access to documents or the
   ability to revoke access at any time, even after the document has been shared.
4. **Encryption**: Encrypts content to prevent unauthorized access. Only authorized users with the
   correct credentials or keys can decrypt and access the information.
5. **Audit and Monitoring**: Provides logging and reporting features to track who accessed the
   document, when, and what actions were taken, helping ensure compliance and detecting potential
   data breaches.

#### Use Cases for IRM:

- **Corporate Document Protection**: Protects sensitive internal documents like financial reports,
  intellectual property, strategic plans, and contracts.
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: Helps prevent data breaches and unauthorized sharing by
  controlling access and usage of confidential information.
- **Compliance**: Ensures adherence to legal and regulatory requirements (such as GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
  by controlling and monitoring access to sensitive data.

### Digital Rights Management (DRM)

**Digital Rights Management (DRM)** is a broader term that encompasses technologies used to control
access to and usage of digital content to prevent unauthorized use, distribution, or reproduction.
DRM is primarily used in the entertainment and media industries to protect digital content, such as
music, movies, eBooks, and software.

#### Key Features of DRM:

1. **Access Control**: Controls who can access digital content based on licenses or user accounts.
   This can involve requiring users to log in to verify their rights.
2. **Usage Restrictions**: Limits the ways digital content can be used (e.g., preventing copying,
   screen recording, sharing, or burning onto physical media).
3. **Content Encryption**: Protects digital files by encrypting them. Only authorized users or
   devices with the correct decryption keys can access the content.
4. **Watermarking**: Applies invisible or visible watermarks to digital content, which can be used
   to identify and track unauthorized use or distribution.
5. **Licensing**: Uses licensing mechanisms to define what rights a user has over the content (e.g.,
   limited-time access, a specific number of views or plays).

#### Use Cases for DRM:

- **Music and Movies**: Protects copyrighted music and movies distributed through digital
  platforms (e.g., Spotify, Netflix) from unauthorized copying or sharing.
- **eBooks and Software**: Prevents unauthorized copying or redistribution of digital books,
  software, and applications.
- **Games and Applications**: Secures digital games and software applications against piracy by
  restricting how they can be installed, shared, or used.

### Differences Between IRM and DRM

| **Target Audience**   | Enterprises and organizations                                         | Media and content creators, publishers, and distributors         |
| **Content Type**      | Internal documents, emails, spreadsheets, confidential data           | Music, movies, eBooks, games, software, digital media            |
| **Control Mechanism** | Access and usage permissions based on user roles or policies          | License-based access and usage restrictions                      |
| **Focus**             | Prevents unauthorized access, sharing, or modification of information | Prevents copying, sharing, piracy, and unauthorized distribution |
| **Encryption**        | Often uses strong encryption methods to secure data                   | Uses encryption to protect digital media                         |
| **Flexibility**       | Offers granular control over document usage and distribution          | Focuses on broader access control for media consumption          |

### Similarities Between IRM and DRM

- **Control Access and Usage**: Both IRM and DRM focus on controlling who can access and use digital
  content.
- **Protect Digital Assets**: Both aim to protect digital assets, though their specific applications
  differ (internal documents vs. consumer media).
- **Use of Encryption**: Both employ encryption to safeguard digital information from unauthorized
  access.
- **Compliance and Monitoring**: Both systems provide mechanisms for monitoring access and usage,
  which can be important for compliance purposes.

### Conclusion

While both IRM and DRM are essential for protecting digital content, they serve different purposes
and are implemented in different contexts:

- **IRM** is more focused on internal information security within organizations, providing control
  over documents, emails, and other confidential data.
- **DRM** is geared toward the media and entertainment industries to protect digital content from
  piracy and unauthorized distribution.

### FIPS 140-2

(Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 140-2) is a U.S. government standard that
specifies the security requirements for cryptographic modules used to protect sensitive but
unclassified information. Developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
FIPS 140-2 is widely recognized as a benchmark for cryptographic security and is often mandated for
government agencies, contractors, and organizations handling sensitive data.

### SOX

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) is a U.S. federal law that was enacted in 2002 to protect investors by
improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures in financial statements. It was
passed in response to several major corporate and accounting scandals, such as those involving
Enron, WorldCom, and Tyco, which shook public confidence in the U.S. securities markets.

### SOC

SOC (System and Organization Controls) reports are a set of standards designed by the American
Institute of CPAs (AICPA)

#### SOC 1: Financial Reporting

**Purpose:** SOC 1 reports focus on internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR). They are
typically used by service organizations that provide services which could impact a client's
financial reporting. These reports are primarily intended for the clients (user entities) and their
auditors.
**Key Users:** Financial auditors, regulatory authorities, and clients concerned with financial
reporting.

###### SOC 1 Type 1:

**Scope**: Describes a service organization’s system and the suitability of the design of controls
as of
a specific point in time (e.g., the design of controls on December 31, 2023).
**Objective**: To determine whether the system's design is appropriate to achieve the control
objectives.
**Usage**: Typically used for initial reporting or when a client is primarily interested in knowing
if
the controls are adequately designed.

###### SOC 1 Type 2:

**Scope**: Includes everything in a Type 1 report but also assesses the operational effectiveness of
the
controls over a period of time (e.g., controls tested from January 1 to December 31, 2023).
**Objective**: To provide a higher level of assurance by demonstrating that the controls are not
only
designed correctly but are also operating effectively over time.
**Usage**: Preferred by clients and auditors for its more comprehensive evaluation. It’s useful when
ongoing assurance of control effectiveness is necessary.

### SOC 2: Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy

**Purpose**: SOC 2 reports are designed to assess a service organization’s controls relevant to
security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. These reports are often
used by companies that handle sensitive data or provide IT services.
**Key Users**: Management, customers, and stakeholders interested in understanding the
organization’s
controls over data security and privacy.

##### SOC 2 Type 1:

**Scope**: Describes a service organization’s system and the suitability of the design of controls
related to the trust service criteria as of a specific point in time.
**Objective**: To assess whether the controls are suitably designed to meet the trust service
criteria.
**Usage:** Typically used when a client wants to verify that proper controls are in place at a
specific
point in time, especially for new service providers or systems.

##### SOC 2 Type 2:

**Scope**: Includes everything in a Type 1 report but also tests the operational effectiveness of
those
controls over a period of time.
Objective: To provide assurance that the controls not only meet the trust service criteria but are
also operating effectively over the testing period.
**Usage**: Often required for ongoing relationships, particularly when clients or regulators need
assurance that data security and privacy controls are consistently effective.

#### SOC 3: General Use Report

**Purpose**: SOC 3 reports cover the same information as SOC 2 but are intended for a general
audience.
They do not provide the same level of detail as SOC 2 reports but are suitable for marketing
purposes and for sharing with a broader audience, such as customers and stakeholders who do not need
the detailed information included in a SOC 2 report.
**Key Users**: General public, customers, and stakeholders interested in a high-level assurance of
security and privacy controls.

##### SOC 3:

**Scope**: Provides a summary of the SOC 2 report without the detailed testing and results.
**Objective**: To provide general assurance to a wide audience that the service organization has met
the
necessary trust service criteria.
**Usage**: Ideal for organizations looking to publicly demonstrate their commitment to security and
privacy without disclosing sensitive information.
