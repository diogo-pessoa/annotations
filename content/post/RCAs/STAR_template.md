## Simple Experience Template (Why / What / How)

### **Why** *(Situation + Task)*

* Why did this matter?
* What problem or goal triggered the situation?
* What was at stake if nothing was done?

---

### **What** *(Action)*

* What did I decide to do?
* What were the key steps or decisions?
* What did I personally own?

---

### **How** *(Result)*

* How did it turn out?
* How do I know it worked? (signal, metric, outcome)
* How did this change things afterward?
