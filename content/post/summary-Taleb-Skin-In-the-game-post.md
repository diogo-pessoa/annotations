Notes from Blog Post and favorites parts of _Taleb, N. N. (2018) What do I mean by Skin in the Game?
My Own Version, INCERTO_ [1](#references)

## No Opinions without consequences (From bed of Procustes)

From article:

> _My argument is that there is a more essential aspect: filtering and the facilitation of
evolution.
> Skin in the game –as a filter –is the central pillar for the organic functioning of systems,
> whether
> humans or natural. Unless consequential decisions are taken by people who pay for the
> consequences,
> the world would vulnerable to total systemic collapse_

— _Nassim N. Taleb_

## The System sanitizes iteself (Risk-blind traders become taxi drivers)

> _The captain who goes down with the ship will no longer have a ship. Bad pilots end up in the
bottom
of the Atlantic Ocean; risk-blind traders become taxi drivers or surfing instructors (if they traded
their own money)._

— _Nassim N. Taleb_

## Thinking in Systems

`(Note to add correlation)` - reminds me of Donella meadows, (2008) thinking in systems[2](#references).

> Systems learn at the collective level by the mechanism of selection: by eliminating those elements
> that reduce the fitness of the whole, provided these have skin in the game.
> ...
> And in the absence of the filtering of skin in the game, the mechanisms of evolution fail: if
> someone else dies in your stead, the built up of asymmetric risks and misfitness will cause the
> system to eventually blow-up.

— _Nassim N. Taleb_
