## Summary

My interpretations from topics throughout book/interviews


## Determined

Discussion about **Game theory** on [Peter Attia PodCast interview](#) `(find transcript)`. 

While discussing the cost of intervening or not in a conflict (energy intensive activity, 
without a direct benefit from it).


* if you _"pay"_ to punish the abuser, it is at your own expense (costs energy, calories may be 
  limited). If you don't benefit at all, that could be defined as a truly altruistic behaviour.
* In nature, isn't a common behaviour, if the individual gets involved its either for its own 
  benefit or a biological response (instictm, genetic programming?) to benefit indirectly (later)
  . A  group ousting a aggressive leader, by collectively attacking the stronger foe. ...
* Discussions shifts to individual feeling, getting involved (helping) "**feels good**". 
  Therefore, I'm immediately benefiting from such action, even at the energy cost. I could 
  still benefit later from a "safer" environment,
