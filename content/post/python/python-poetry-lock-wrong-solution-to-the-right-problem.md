## **📌 Introduction**

I reflecting on dependency management in Python with **Poetry**, which provides a `poetry.lock` file to ensure **reproducibility**. However, after diving deeper into its mechanics, a key question emerged:

> **Does `poetry.lock` solve the right problem, or is it simply a workaround for a deeper issue?**

This reflection explores why `poetry.lock` might actually be **hindering** rather than **helping** dependency management and proposes **a better approach** for ensuring both stability and security.

---

## **🔒 Why Does `poetry.lock` Exist?**

The `poetry.lock` file is designed to:
- **Freeze dependencies and sub-dependencies** at exact versions.
- Ensure **identical environments** for developers and CI/CD pipelines.
- Avoid unexpected updates that could break the application.

In theory, this sounds great. But in practice, it introduces **major security and flexibility concerns**.

---

## **❌ The Problem with `poetry.lock`**

### 🚨 **1. Dependency Locking Freezes Updates—Even Security Fixes**

Let’s say your project depends on `requests`, which in turn depends on `urllib3`. Here’s how `requests` typically defines its dependencies:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
requests = "^2.31.0"
```

If you check `requests`' actual dependencies, you’ll see something like:

```yaml
install_requires:
  - urllib3 >=1.21.1, <3
  - idna >=2.5, <4
  - charset-normalizer >=2, <4
```

This means `requests` **allows** new versions of `urllib3` **as long as they fit** the `>=1.21.1,<3` constraint.

🚨 **Issue:** If `urllib3` releases a security patch (e.g., `2.2.0`), Poetry **won’t update it automatically** if `poetry.lock` is present. Instead, your project remains stuck on the previously resolved version **until you manually run `poetry update`**.

**Example:** Suppose your `poetry.lock` file has:

```yaml
[[package]]
name = "urllib3"
version = "2.1.0"
```

Even though `urllib3==2.2.0` is a security update, Poetry **won’t use it** unless you explicitly update.

✅ **Better Approach:** Instead of freezing dependencies, the package manager should allow automatic minor and patch updates while preventing major version changes.

---

### 🔄 **2. Different Developers Should Get Different Versions**

One of the strongest arguments against `poetry.lock` is:

> **A developer installing the project a month later should NOT get the same locked dependencies—it’s insecure by design.**

With `poetry.lock`, dependency resolution is **frozen**, meaning:
- Two developers working at different times could use outdated packages.
- CI/CD pipelines might run on insecure dependencies **even if safer versions exist**.

Instead, dependencies should **evolve naturally** within their constraints, just like in Rust’s `cargo` ecosystem.

✅ **Better Approach:** Allow automatic updates within minor versions while logging any significant changes.

---

### 🔍 **3. The Real Problem: Weak Correlation Between Versions & Sub-Dependencies**

Currently, Python packages define **version ranges** rather than strict sub-dependencies:

```yaml
requests 2.31.0:
  - urllib3 >=1.21.1, <3
  - idna >=2.5, <4
  - certifi >=2017.4.17
```

🚨 **Issue:** The same package version (`requests 2.31.0`) can lead to different dependency resolutions at different times.

✅ **Better Approach:**
- Encourage **library maintainers** to include a **stronger dependency BOM (Bill of Materials)**.
- Introduce a **hybrid resolution model** that prefers pinned versions **unless overridden**.

---

## **⚡ An alternative approach to  `locks`**

### ✅ **1. Allow Automatic Minor & Patch Updates**
Instead of locking all dependencies **forever**, the package manager should:
- Install the **latest compatible versions** within the defined constraints.
- Only prevent **major version changes** unless explicitly updated.

#### 🔧 **Example: Smarter Versioning Rules**
Instead of this rigid `poetry.lock` file:
```yaml
[[package]]
name = "urllib3"
version = "2.1.0"
```

Use a smarter system that:
- Always fetches the latest **minor or patch version**.
- Notifies users if a major version update is available.

---

### ✅ **2. Other Package Management do that, ex: Rust’s `cargo`**
Rust’s package manager, `cargo`, **does not lock patch updates by default**. Instead, it intelligently updates within the allowed ranges while preventing breaking changes.

#### **Example: Cargo's Approach**
```toml
[dependencies]
serde = "1.0"  # Automatically gets 1.x.x but not 2.0
```

✅ This keeps software **secure and up to date** without forcing lock files.

---

### ✅ **3. Introduce Package-Level BOMs**
Instead of locking dependencies **at the project level**, **packages themselves** should specify their own **exact sub-dependencies**.

Example: `requests` should **internally** define (and maybe it does already):

```yaml
requests 2.31.0:
  - urllib3 ==2.2.0
  - idna ==3.6
  - certifi ==2023.11.17
```
This ensures **consistent installs across all projects** without relying on `locks`.

---

## **🔮 Final Thoughts: Is `poetry.lock` Solving the Wrong Problem?**

While `poetry.lock` ensures **deterministic builds**, it:
- **Blocks security patches** unless manually updated.
- **Prevents natural version evolution**, making software stale.
- **Attempts to control dependencies at the wrong level** (application instead of library).

### 🚀 **The Better Path Forward**:
- **Allow automatic minor/patch updates**.
- **Encourage package-level BOMs** for more predictable sub-dependencies.
- **Adopt a smarter resolution model**, similar to other package managers.

With these changes, **Python packaging can move toward a model that is both secure and stable**—without the unnecessary burden of `poetry.lock`. 🔥

Reflecting on poetry lock reminded me of a poker saying: 'Just because you won the hand doesn’t mean you played it well.'
